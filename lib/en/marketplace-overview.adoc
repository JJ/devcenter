[.lead]
The Marketplace provides users of OpenShift Online with self-service, on-demand provisioning of Add-on Services. Add-ons are categorized generally into two areas, application services and devops services. For application services, common uses include data persistence, search, caching, messaging, and more. For devops services, Add-ons provide software lifecycle capabilities such as continuous integration and load testing.  

== Using Marketplace Add-on Services
To use an Add-on Service with your application, you must access the Marketplace, subscribe to an Add-on Service, and then bind the Add-on instance to your application (for link:#services-list[services that support binding]).

[[access-marketplace]]
=== Step 1 - Accessing the OpenShift Marketplace
You can access the OpenShift Marketplace directly by visiting link:https://marketplace.openshift.com/[marketplace.openshift.com]. Use the *Login* link in the upper right corner to automatically sign in using your OpenShift Online account.

[[subscribe-service]]
=== Step 2 - Subscribing to a Marketplace Add-on Service
Subscribing to an Add-on Service is easy. Start by selecting the Add-on Service you would like to use.

After the checkout process is completed click the *Go to Products* button to view your active service subscriptions.

NOTE: You will need to complete the checkout process even if the Add-on Service plan you selected is free.

[[bind-service]]
=== Step 3 - Binding a Marketplace Add-on to Your Application
To bind a Marketplace Add-on Service to your application start by navigating to your link:https://marketplace.openshift.com/openshift#accounts[Purchased Products]. Next, click the *Add to Apps* button.

NOTE: Not all Marketplace Add-on Services support binding. See the link:#services-list[list of Marketplace Add-on Services] to learn which services support binding.

image::marketplace/marketplace_purchased.png[OpenShift Marketplace purchased products page]

You will be presented with a list of your applications. Click the *Connect* button next to the application you would like to bind your service to.

Your service is now connected to your application.

Click *Back to your services* to return to the full list of your services. You should now see your application listed under *Connected Apps* for your service.

[[provider-dashboard]]
=== Step 4 - Accessing the Service Provider's Dashboard
Note the *<Service> account overview* link available on the link:https://marketplace.openshift.com/openshift#accounts[purchased products] page (shown above). Clicking the link will automatically log you in to your Marketplace-created account with the service provider. The service provider's dashboard allows you to manage many additional settings:

TIP: You can also access the service provider dashbaord by viewing your application within the OpenShift Web Console, clicking the *details* link for your Add-on Service, and then clicking on the link to the service provider's dashboard.

[[environment-variables]]
=== Step 5 - Using Enviornmnet Variables
Some Marketplace Add-on Services support the concept of binding. OpenShift applications can be bound with Marketplace Add-on that support this feature. When you bind an application to a Marketplace Add-on, details about the Add-on (account credentials, hostnames, ports, etc.) are written to environment variables in the application runtime. Your application can use this information to integrate with the Add-on Service.

==== Available Marketplace Add-on Services
The table below provides a full list of Marketplace Add-on Services and, for services that support binding, their corresponding environment variable prefix. Click on the name of the Add-on Service provider in the table below to view a full list of environment variables.
